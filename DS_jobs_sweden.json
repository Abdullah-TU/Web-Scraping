{"Country_name": "Sweden", "company_name": "Ark Kapital", "keywords": ["AI", "SQL"], "description": "What is ArK?There are many consumer facing fintech products, but finance as a whole is virtually untouched by technology. Investment decisions are still being made off of pdf’s and “shark tank”-like processes rather than utilising the forecasting methods found at companies like Spotify or Google. This makes capital allocation riddled with bias and very ripe for disruption. At ArK we’re convinced that by putting data and tech at the heart of finance we can impact how money flows and, in turn, create a more democratised and unbiased economy.Today we offer founders access to our machine learning platform AIM. Through connecting their raw data we can fully understand what they’ve built without any bias; connecting what has been achieved historically into a simulated 5-year future. This prediction is the foundation for the transformational loans that we are able to issue, and a tool that founders get to keep for business optimisation.ArK was founded in 2021 by a six-time entrepreneur, a world-class AI technology developer and a veteran banker. Since then we’ve carefully grown our team to 70 - all pitching in with their experience to build something that none of us has seen before. ArK is headquartered in Stockholm but we balance our time between being at the office and working remotely.Data Analyst AssociateAs a Data Analyst Associate at ArK, you will be working closely with our data scientists, commercial teams, engineering and design. Your goal is to ensure we are able to make the best credit decisions in the world, and that we do so in an increasingly scalable and automated way. Together we build AIM, our analytics platform, that not only helps us develop financial products, but is also turning into an amazing tool for founders of growth companies to use. In other words, the analysis we do isn’t kept to ourselves, but something we share interactive access to with our customers. Data Analysts at ArK develop the insights that we package there, and the vision is to give its users an unfair competitive advantage. Who are you?Someone who enjoys learning new things and tools, and who enjoys pushing themselves and others to growYou likely have an economics or STEM background, but we really value broad perspectives, so if you come from elsewhere but have an inclination for data, tech or business — you’re more than welcome to applyAround 1-3 years hands-on experience with modern data analytics, using tools like SQL, dbt, Python, R and probably some dashboarding solution.Nice-to-haveA good understanding of statistics and advanced data modellingExperience running projects and collaborating with external stakeholdersExperience setting up KPIs and understanding their driversAn interest in business and what makes (some) companies succeedWhat’s it like to work at ArK?We believe that the key to a great team culture is great people having a great time together.

I ditt arbete kan även ingå att undervisa eller att delta i andra institutionsuppdrag, upp till 20% av heltid.Du kommer börja med att arbeta i projekt ”Urban Air Mobility, regional services”. I projektet utformas framtida luftrum för drönare (tillsammans med annan flygtrafik), tillsammans med representanter från olika regioner i Sverige. I projektet tar vi fram en metodik för det. Du kommer arbeta med att ta fram och utvärdera den metodiken. Ditt fokus blir visuella interaktiva förklaringar, av hur olika aspekter av hur avancerad luftrumsmobilitet fungerar, samt av det luftrum och de tjänster man utformar i olika workshops (vad har man utformat, hur ser man på det). Du kommer dels att utforma dessa förklaringar i form av interaktiva prototyper, dels använda och utvärdera dem, exempelvis under projektets workshops. Det arbetet inkluderar användning av vetenskaplig metod för datainsamling och analys. Arbetet kommer också att kunna beröra andra projekt, exempelvis inom automation, och beröra interaktiva förklaringar som involverar automation. Arbetet är projektbaserat, och du förväntas arbeta i finansierade projekt samt anpassa ditt arbete till projekten, inom de ramar och med fokus på de projektmål som är aktuella i projekten. I arbetet ingår exempelvis designarbete, forskning angående din design, arbete för att driva det omgivande projektet framåt (t.ex. rapporter, presentationer) samt rapportering av forskning (vetenskapliga artiklar). Du förväntas också delta i gemensamma seminarier och aktiviteter vid avdelningen och LiU.Angående undervisning förväntas du kunna bidra i kurser som assistent i laborationer, lektioner (t.ex. angående verktyg och tekniker) seminarieledare, föreläsare, handledare, och bedöma studentarbeten – särskilt inom designområdet, inklusive relevanta verktyg (se kvalifikationer). Undervisning kan ske på engelska, men även på svenska. Initialt förväntas du exempelvis arbeta i kursen TNGD34 interaktiv informationsdesign samt handleda examensarbeten inom grafisk design och kommunikation.Din arbetsplatsDu kommer arbeta på avdelningen för Medie- och Informationsteknik MIT, vid Institutionen för teknik och naturvetenskap på Linköpings universitet, i vårt forskarteam som bedriver forskning inom samarbete människa-automation. Verksamheten bedrivs primärt på campus Norrköping men även på Campus Valla. Vi bedriver ett flertal projekt inom området, exempelvis ”Urban Air Mobility, Regional Services”, ”Navigationsstöd från Land”, ”Flexibel Automation”, ”Remote Operations Centre”, ”Automationsprogrammet II”, ”Human AI teaming Knowledge and Understanding for aviation safety” (se https://ivis.itn.liu.se/research/areas/hat.html). Vår forskning behandlar tillämpningsdomäner, och bedrivs i samarbete med domänexperter från respektive tillämpningsområde. I forskargruppen har vi informella möten, i regel varje vecka för att kunna samarbeta. Forskningen gäller i första hand studier tillämpade på flygtrafikledning och ledning av sjöfart, i vårt samarbete med luftfartsverket (LFV) och Sjöfartsverket. Det innebär att du kommer att arbeta i samarbete med personal i dessa organisationer, och i till viss del förlagt platser där verksamhet och testverksamhet bedrivs (exempelvis resa till och delta i / leda workshops med regioner, eventuellt också i olika centraler t.ex. för flygtrafikledning). Simulatormiljöer finns även vid LIU.Dina kvalifikationerDu har avlagt examen på avancerad nivå inom design eller slutfört kurser om minst 240 högskolepoäng varav minst 60 högskolepoäng på avancerad nivå inom design eller på något annat sätt förvärvat i huvudsak motsvarande kunskaper.Du behöver ha kunskaper i visuell design och berättande (Storytelling). Meriter i relevanta designverktyg och designprojekt är meriterande, inklusive Adobe programvara, Dataton Watchout (eller motsvarande). Dessa meriter är viktiga både för forskning och undervisning.Då vi arbetar inom området luftfart så är kunskaper inom luftfart och arbete med drönartjänster, så är kunskap inom flygtrafikledning och luftfart också meriterande. Designarbeten som berör luftfart är extra meriterande, även designarbeten som berör andra process-styrnings domäner är meriterande. Exempel på att använda design inom forskning är också meriterande.Observera att workshops i projektet ”Urban Air Mobility, Regional Services” primärt genomförs på svenska, du måste behärska svenska tillräckligt bra för att förstå dessa samtal och kunna delta – därmed är det också ett krav för anställningen. Projektrapportering och vetenskaplig rapportering genomförs primärt på engelska, därmed är det även ett krav att du behärskar engelska.Om anställningenI samband med tillträde till anställningen kommer du att antas till forskarutbildningen. Läs mer om respektive fakultets forskarutbildning här.Anställningen är tidsbegränsad till fyra år heltid. Du anställs till en början på ett år, och därefter förnyas anställningen med högst två år i taget, utifrån uppnådd studieplan. Förlängning av anställning upp till fem år sker utifrån grad av undervisnings- och institutionsuppdrag. Vid särskilda skäl kan ytterligare förlängning ske.Tillträde 1 september 2023.Lön och förmånerDoktorandlönen regleras utifrån en lokalt avtalad lönestege.
