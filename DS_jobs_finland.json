For us it’s a clear win-win situation, but it takes an entire team to make sure that this is possible. 💪 So, in order to achieve our mission to build the best tools for keeping the fine balance between planning and forecasting of delivery services at any given time and place, we decided to strengthen our ranks by adding one more Backend Engineer to our teams in the Courier Group to balance out our own team needs!You will be working with frontend engineers, UX designers, backend engineers, and data scientists, and right now we’re building our supply and demand forecasting systems of the future, but we need your help in doing so! So, if you’re an experienced Python charmer with a background in machine learning or similar field, an interest in tackling scalability challenges, and building some real cool stuff, then be sure to drop us a line. 🐍 Also, you’ll get a chance to work closely together with our brilliant Data Scientists (seriously, this is a great chance to learn a lot about data science if you have a knack for it)!Still not sure? As a backend engineer, you will have a big impact on the team and you will be a key player in building a new platform that will help us create reliable forecasts which consume large amounts of operator sourced data where operators can input and alter planning data and can trigger model runs based on their inputs. You’ll also work on designing and implementing APIs, helping data scientists integrate their new ML-based models, as well as setting up data pipelines between our backend and data warehouse, so there’s quite a lot of exciting things going on!📍These roles can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany or Sweden.

For us it’s a clear win-win situation, but it takes an entire team to make sure that this is possible. 💪 So, in order to achieve our mission to build the best tools for keeping the fine balance between planning and forecasting of delivery services at any given time and place, we decided to strengthen our ranks by adding one more Backend Engineer to our teams in the Courier Group to balance out our own team needs!You will be working with frontend engineers, UX designers, backend engineers, and data scientists, and right now we’re building our supply and demand forecasting systems of the future, but we need your help in doing so!

{"Country_name": "Finland", "company_name": "Wolt", "keywords": ["ML", "SQL"], "description": "Job DescriptionAt the fast growing scale of the Wolt business our operational efficiency benefits greatly from having automation for managing supply (how many courier partners are online) and demand (how many orders are being placed by customers). For us it’s a clear win-win situation, but it takes an entire team to make sure that this is possible. 💪 So, in order to achieve our mission to build the best tools for keeping the fine balance between planning and forecasting of delivery services at any given time and place, we decided to strengthen our ranks by adding one more Backend Engineer to our teams in the Courier Group to balance out our own team needs!You will be working with frontend engineers, UX designers, backend engineers, and data scientists, and right now we’re building our supply and demand forecasting systems of the future, but we need your help in doing so! So, if you’re an experienced Python charmer with a background in machine learning or similar field, an interest in tackling scalability challenges, and building some real cool stuff, then be sure to drop us a line. 🐍 Also, you’ll get a chance to work closely together with our brilliant Data Scientists (seriously, this is a great chance to learn a lot about data science if you have a knack for it)!Still not sure? As a backend engineer, you will have a big impact on the team and you will be a key player in building a new platform that will help us create reliable forecasts which consume large amounts of operator sourced data where operators can input and alter planning data and can trigger model runs based on their inputs. You’ll also work on designing and implementing APIs, helping data scientists integrate their new ML-based models, as well as setting up data pipelines between our backend and data warehouse, so there’s quite a lot of exciting things going on!📍These roles can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany or Sweden.
