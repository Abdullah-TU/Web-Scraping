Based on the supply chain risk we define the complex parts for a new product. You will lead the process to bring one or more of these complex parts towards industrialization. If applicable you will be involved in supply chain design and supplier selection process. Once the supplier is known you will start the industrialization process with the supplier. Since the teams develop high tech modules against challenging timeline, most of the time material availability is at risk. We do apply concurrent engineering when creating the design and parts/module manufacturing at the supplier. While doing this you have to make sure you manage the timely industrialization of these complex parts during the execution of the manufacturing process at the supplier.Examples of QLTCS roadmap targets you secure for the first deliveries, ramp up and volume are:Quality: Analyze supplier feedback, Process FMEAs, optimize manufacturing flow (across suppliers), Yield, Material Notifications, Quality-docs;Logistics: Supplier cycle time, Move rate at supplier, Flexibility of the move rate, Material availability;Technology: Design FMEA’s, Technical issue management at supplier, Completeness design documentation;Costs: Cost of Goods and total cost of ownership, Supplier investments;Sustainability: Refurbishment/repair capabilities, Re-use of modules/partsDuring this process, some of the foreseen risks become issues. Until the part/module is industrialized you are responsible to mitigate and ultimately solve these problems with the teams and supplier. This includes organizing a successful x-sector team with sufficient solving power, as well as regular report out towards senior management.Travel required: 20-25%Need to know more about applying for a job at ASML?

Most recent CMOS technologies allow the integration of several billions of transistors in a digital microprocessor chip the size of a fingernail. While technology downscaling has been extremely beneficial for digital circuits, the design of analog frontend electronics and Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) in deep sub-micron CMOS technologies is becoming increasingly challenging due to the systematic power supply reduction, the intrinsically larger device parameter variability, and the higher low-frequency noise level of these transistors. To achieve high performance while ensuring a high level of reliability, complex and accurate calibration circuits need to be added to the ICs to counteract these effects. However, the design of these calibration circuits is challenging, and their effectiveness is typically limited to specific operating conditions.This project is done in cooperation with NXP semiconductors, Eindhoven.Your dutiesAs a PhD researcher from the Integrated Circuits group, you will investigate a novel methodology to design and implement calibration techniques for Analog-to-Digital Converters with the aid of Machine Learning (ML). During your PhD you will first identify the root causes which limit ADC performance. Next you will investigate suitable ML algorithms to correct these errors, calibrate the ADC behavior and improve its performance. Finally, you will design a novel ADC with embedded ML calibration circuits, achieving beyond state-of-the-art performance.In summary your main tasks will be:Analyze and identify the major root causes which limit the performance of specific state-of-the-art ADCs.Explore new design methodologies to post-correct errors in ADCs and enable smart calibrations using Machine Learning.Investigate methods to efficiently train the ML algorithms using a reduced set of data points.Demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed approach by designing, implementing and characterizing Analog-to-Digital Converters achieving a performance beyond current state-of-the-art.Dissemination of the results of your research in international and peer-reviewed journals and conferences.

Most recent CMOS technologies allow the integration of several billions of transistors in a digital microprocessor chip the size of a fingernail. However, the design of ICs in advanced CMOS technology nodes requires heavy verification tests based on simulations to estimate the achieved circuit performance prior manufacturing. As circuit complexity increases, so does the required simulations time and thus the verification costs. Consequently, the development of next generation electronic solutions will require increasing time-to markets as well as significant investments of the semiconductor industry in human-labor resources leading to higher costs and potentially limited availability of consumer electronic solutions.In this scenario, within the Integrated Circuits (IC) group we are currently investigating new verification approaches and design methodologies based on Machine Learning (ML) models which aim to shorten the simulation time by 10x. However, the data required to train these ML models needs also to be generated by means of circuit simulations. Therefore, smart and efficient training of the models which minimizes the number of datapoints is of paramount important for the success of this research.This project is done in cooperation with NXP semiconductors, Eindhoven.Your dutiesAs a postdoctoral researcher from the Integrated Circuits group, you will mainly focus on the investigation of smart sampling techniques e.g., based on Bayesian optimization to efficiently train the Machine Learning models used in the circuit simulator.

{"Country_name": "Netherlands", "company_name": "Technische Universiteit Eindhoven", "keywords": ["ML"], "description": "In the last 40 years, the systematic downscaling of CMOS Integrated Circuit (IC) technologies has enabled unprecedented improvements in the transistor density, frequency of operation, energy efficiency and reliability. Most recent CMOS technologies allow the integration of several billions of transistors in a digital microprocessor chip the size of a fingernail. While technology downscaling has been extremely beneficial for digital circuits, the design of analog frontend electronics and Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) in deep sub-micron CMOS technologies is becoming increasingly challenging due to the systematic power supply reduction, the intrinsically larger device parameter variability, and the higher low-frequency noise level of these transistors. To achieve high performance while ensuring a high level of reliability, complex and accurate calibration circuits need to be added to the ICs to counteract these effects. However, the design of these calibration circuits is challenging, and their effectiveness is typically limited to specific operating conditions.This project is done in cooperation with NXP semiconductors, Eindhoven.Your dutiesAs a PhD researcher from the Integrated Circuits group, you will investigate a novel methodology to design and implement calibration techniques for Analog-to-Digital Converters with the aid of Machine Learning (ML). During your PhD you will first identify the root causes which limit ADC performance. Next you will investigate suitable ML algorithms to correct these errors, calibrate the ADC behavior and improve its performance. Finally, you will design a novel ADC with embedded ML calibration circuits, achieving beyond state-of-the-art performance.In summary your main tasks will be:Analyze and identify the major root causes which limit the performance of specific state-of-the-art ADCs.Explore new design methodologies to post-correct errors in ADCs and enable smart calibrations using Machine Learning.Investigate methods to efficiently train the ML algorithms using a reduced set of data points.Demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed approach by designing, implementing and characterizing Analog-to-Digital Converters achieving a performance beyond current state-of-the-art.Dissemination of the results of your research in international and peer-reviewed journals and conferences.

Most recent CMOS technologies allow the integration of several billions of transistors in a digital microprocessor chip the size of a fingernail. However, the design of ICs in advanced CMOS technology nodes requires heavy verification tests based on simulations to estimate the achieved circuit performance prior manufacturing. As circuit complexity increases, so does the required simulations time and thus the verification costs. Consequently, the development of next generation electronic solutions will require increasing time-to markets as well as significant investments of the semiconductor industry in human-labor resources leading to higher costs and potentially limited availability of consumer electronic solutions.In this scenario, within the Integrated Circuits (IC) group we are currently investigating new verification approaches and design methodologies based on Machine Learning (ML) models which aim to shorten the simulation time by 10x. However, the data required to train these ML models needs also to be generated by means of circuit simulations. Therefore, smart and efficient training of the models which minimizes the number of datapoints is of paramount important for the success of this research.This project is done in cooperation with NXP semiconductors, Eindhoven.Your dutiesAs a postdoctoral researcher from the Integrated Circuits group, you will mainly focus on the investigation of smart sampling techniques e.g., based on Bayesian optimization to efficiently train the Machine Learning models used in the circuit simulator.

Come and provide the Data Science Team with some fresh energy. We provide the opportunity to gain work experience and get acquainted with Kadaster. Put yourself on the map by applying for the following:Data Science InternKadaster’s Data Science Team is involved in various innovation projects and support various organisational challenges. You work, in collaboration with EuroSDR, on assignments related to graph alignment, metadata management and semantic technologies.Background information on the cooperation with EuroSDREuroSDR (non-profit organisation) links national mapping and cadastral agencies to research institutes, universities and companies in Europe. They do this to support applied research in spatial data provision, management and delivery. Kadaster supports the ‘Linking Data in Europe’ project within the EuroSDR working group on Linked Data. This project has attracted EuroSDR members and their network across Europe and supports the linking of data based on metadata using semantic technologies.The EuroSDR project ‘Linking Data in Europe’ focuses primarily on the transformation and publication of metadata to linked data, combining metadata on both a structural and semantic level and creating tools which support the linking of metadata records to each other. The most important deliverable for this project is the metadata knowledge graph (MKG).Combining data from different domains and different countries remains a challenge. This is due to the lack of homogeneity in both the structure and semantics of this data. In addition, merging datasets for different use cases first requires that relevant datasets be found and that the content can be selected for reuse. Losing time finding information, understanding what is useful for the use case and combining this information in a logical way leaves less time and money to create real value by using this data for a range of use cases.Metadata is central to supporting both findability and accessibility of data. The metadata must be of sufficient quality and rich enough that users can decide on the data that is relevant to a particular use case.Both internships will be guided by members of the EuroSDR Linked Data group and interns will have frequent contact with the project group and the partner organizations involved. Two internships have been defined to support this project.What are you going to do?You can choose from one of the below assignments:Internship 1: Development of the Metadata WizardWe want to support users in the transformation from meta data to linked data and support in editing and enriching metadata for publication in the metadata knowledge graph. It is, therefore, important to provide users with the right tooling. The requirements for this tool have been drawn up by members of the EuroSDR Linked Data Group. One of these requirements is that the tool be developed based on the LDWizard: https://github.com/pldn/LDWizard, which is an open-source tool that supports the transformation from data to linked data in a user-friendly way.The selected intern will work towards building a toolset that will import in an intelligent way metadata from diverse sources related to spatiotemporal data and will add this metadata to a Knowledge Graph(KG) where they can be linked with previously existing metadata. The developed toolset would need to process, understand, link and semantically enrich the provided metadata.Internship 2: Graph Alignment, Semantic Mapping and OntologiesMetadata for digital assets in Europe exists in different formats with a range of standards and vocabularies. However, metadata follows its own semantic descriptions using one or more of the metadata vocabularies, which are ultimately part of the MKG. Before the metadata to linked data transformation can be performed, the range of metadata vocabularies must be identified and aligned.We do this to support the semantic and structural homogeneity of metadata. This enables us to enrich existing metadata with more information. To support improved findability and searchability of digital resources in Europe. Modern solutions in this area include the use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enable greater intelligence and precise alignment and linkage of the spatiotemporal metadata.You design the model for the metadata knowledge graph and transform instance data to create the metadata knowledge graph.The teamThe Data Science Team consists of 17 colleagues. We take a look both inside and outside Kadaster at the very latest technologies, such as data science, data innovations and opportunities for collaboration. We help our colleagues with various issues and work together with external parties such as universities. We apply technology where it is possible that it contributes to the digital transformation of Kadaster.

This project has attracted EuroSDR members and their network across Europe and supports the linking of data based on metadata using semantic technologies.The EuroSDR project ‘Linking Data in Europe’ focuses primarily on the transformation and publication of metadata to linked data, combining metadata on both a structural and semantic level and creating tools which support the linking of metadata records to each other. The most important deliverable for this project is the metadata knowledge graph (MKG).Combining data from different domains and different countries remains a challenge. This is due to the lack of homogeneity in both the structure and semantics of this data. In addition, merging datasets for different use cases first requires that relevant datasets be found and that the content can be selected for reuse. Losing time finding information, understanding what is useful for the use case and combining this information in a logical way leaves less time and money to create real value by using this data for a range of use cases.Metadata is central to supporting both findability and accessibility of data. The metadata must be of sufficient quality and rich enough that users can decide on the data that is relevant to a particular use case.Both internships will be guided by members of the EuroSDR Linked Data group and interns will have frequent contact with the project group and the partner organizations involved. Two internships have been defined to support this project.What are you going to do?You can choose from one of the below assignments:Internship 1: Development of the Metadata WizardWe want to support users in the transformation from meta data to linked data and support in editing and enriching metadata for publication in the metadata knowledge graph. It is, therefore, important to provide users with the right tooling. The requirements for this tool have been drawn up by members of the EuroSDR Linked Data Group. One of these requirements is that the tool be developed based on the LDWizard: https://github.com/pldn/LDWizard, which is an open-source tool that supports the transformation from data to linked data in a user-friendly way.The selected intern will work towards building a toolset that will import in an intelligent way metadata from diverse sources related to spatiotemporal data and will add this metadata to a Knowledge Graph(KG) where they can be linked with previously existing metadata. The developed toolset would need to process, understand, link and semantically enrich the provided metadata.Internship 2: Graph Alignment, Semantic Mapping and OntologiesMetadata for digital assets in Europe exists in different formats with a range of standards and vocabularies. However, metadata follows its own semantic descriptions using one or more of the metadata vocabularies, which are ultimately part of the MKG. Before the metadata to linked data transformation can be performed, the range of metadata vocabularies must be identified and aligned.We do this to support the semantic and structural homogeneity of metadata. This enables us to enrich existing metadata with more information. To support improved findability and searchability of digital resources in Europe. Modern solutions in this area include the use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enable greater intelligence and precise alignment and linkage of the spatiotemporal metadata.You design the model for the metadata knowledge graph and transform instance data to create the metadata knowledge graph.The teamThe Data Science Team consists of 17 colleagues. We take a look both inside and outside Kadaster at the very latest technologies, such as data science, data innovations and opportunities for collaboration. We help our colleagues with various issues and work together with external parties such as universities.

Therefore, the Department of Human Geography, Planning and International Development Studies is looking for an Assistant Professor.The Department is interested in recruiting an early career academic in the field of geography, planning and international development studies or adjacent disciplines passionate about teaching and research centred around the broad theme of digital technology. Candidates should show enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research, have a strong track record of international peer-reviewed publications and be able to develop an innovative research agenda.We are looking for a new colleague whose work engages the socio-spatial dimensions of digitalisation, examining how digital technologies and data emerge within specific spatial contexts and how they co-produce new forms of spatial knowledge, planning and practices. We are specifically interested in how digitalisation reproduces, exacerbates, or disrupts existing socio-spatial inequalities (such as those between neighbourhoods, cities, nation-states, or geopolitical regions). In addition, we are interested in how digital technologies can enhance spatial, environmental and/or urban governance and research. We welcome, in particular, applicants who are enthusiastic about working in an interdisciplinary research environment, engaging digital methodological innovations (e.g. related to GIS), and sharing and co-creating knowledge beyond academic circles.Candidates should have demonstrated experience and interest in teaching we are looking for an inspiring lecturer who can engage a diverse community of students with an inclusive approach to teaching. Being able to teach the application of innovative digital technologies in research would be particularly of interest.The department combines research across human geography, planning and international development studies, with a shared emphasis on the spatiality of societal processes. Its research tradition is characterised by its critical and publicly engaged approach to urgent socio-spatial issues. Our collective mission is to develop empirically grounded, conceptually innovative contributions to intellectual and societal debates, always informed by a sensitivity to the spatial dimension of social phenomena and processes. We focus on the intersections of social, built and natural environments and emphasise the importance of deploying spatial concepts such as scale, place, territoriality, mobility and landscape to investigate the how and why of social issues. We are committed to mobilising our research expertise to address the collective action problems and other real-world challenges associated with pursuing equality, sustainability and economic development.Given our emphasis on theoretical development and societal relevance, our research ranges from more conceptual endeavours to shift academic debates to more concrete, policy-oriented projects. Many of these projects are developed with societal stakeholders, from actors in Amsterdam and at the Dutch national level to transnational networks and UN agencies. Across the department, our scholarship benefits from a commitment to methodological pluralism. Our research draws on various qualitative, quantitative, and spatial methods, from ethnography and statistical analysis to action research and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods.The department’s diverse, internationally oriented staff plays active and influential roles in academic and societal debates.

Lees dan verder!Belangrijke informatie over de stage: De stage vindt deels plaats op het hoofdkantoor van Albert Heijn in Zaandam, maar gezien de COVID-19 omstandigheden wordt er ook vanaf thuis gewerkt. Als team zijn we daar al aan gewend en hebben we goede oplossingen gevonden om toch een geweldige stage op afstand te hebben. De stage start vanaf september 2023 voor een periode van 5 maanden.

Wanneer een idee positief is gevalideerd is team Technology Labs verantwoordelijk voor het uitdenken, uitwerken, opzetten en uitvoeren van pilots met klanten. Op deze manier zorgen we ervoor dat kansrijke ideeën uiteindelijk grootschalig worden uitgerold. Binnen het Team Labs team heerst dan ook een get-things-done-mentaliteit, waarbij creativiteit en valideren met klanten van essentieel belang zijn.
