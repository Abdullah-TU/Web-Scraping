# ✨Web Scraping 💎⛏️

I am embarking on a web scraping project to collect a diverse range of data for my various projects. This data may include text, tables, media files, structured information, and more from a variety of websites. My goal is to gather valuable and relevant information to support my research, analysis, and other project-related endeavors. 

## IMDB Gender images 👨‍💼♂️ 🧕♀️
- Suppose we want to build a data set for a Computer vision task that involves gender images.
- Your tasks are the following:
- a. Collect 10k male/female images from: httos://www.imdb.com
- ■ Make sure to render the whole page using selenium and then use BeautifulSoup to scrape the images
- ■ Create a folder for male/female
-  ■ Each image will be named after the person in the picture
