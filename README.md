# ✨Web Scraping 💎⛏️

I am embarking on a web scraping project to collect a diverse range of data for my various projects. This data may include text, tables, media files, structured information, and more from a variety of websites. My goal is to gather valuable and relevant information to support my research, analysis, and other project-related endeavors. 

## IMDB Gender images 👨‍💼♂️ 🧕♀️
- Suppose we want to build a data set for a Computer vision task that involves gender images.
- Your tasks are the following:
- a. Collect 10k male/female images from: httos://www.imdb.com
- ■ Make sure to render the whole page using selenium and then use BeautifulSoup to scrape the images
- ■ Create a folder for male/female
-  ■ Each image will be named after the person in the picture

## 🌐📊 Unlocking Job Insights in Data Science and machine learning through Web Scraping across Nordic & German Markets 
#DataScienceJobs #MarketResearch

The Integrify project aimed to gather comprehensive insights into the Machine Learning and Data Science job markets across five European countries (Finland, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and Germany). The objective was to optimize the curriculum and practices to enhance students' chances of securing job offers. The project involved specific tasks assigned to each group member, focusing on extensive keyword sets and the identification of 20 companies per country. Job offers from each company were collected over a one-year period, resulting in a structured dataset. Ultimately, five dictionaries were created, each representing a country and containing company-specific keyword-post pairings. The project culminated in the successful acquisition of a substantial number of job listings across all targeted countries.

🤞Outcome:
- Finland: Successfully downloaded a total of 412 jobs.
- Netherlands: Successfully downloaded a total of 191 jobs.
- Denmark: Successfully downloaded a total of 325 jobs.
- Sweden: Successfully downloaded a total of 139 jobs.
- Germany: Successfully downloaded a total of 333 jobs.
